<img src="./img/Node.png" height="15"> developers often consider `MongoDB` to be the main choice when building a data-driven application. However, many alternatives may provide better solutions.

This repository was built with the intention of exploring various database options to connect to Node.js backend such as:

1. MongoDB
2. MySQL
3. Redis.

CRUD operations was built by using JS classes and instances

An important subset of NoSQL databases are key value stores. While key value stores are very limited, they're also very powerful and fast. `Redis` basically stores the data in memory which makes it blazingly fast but also, the data might get lost, if you kill the `Redis` process. 
Redis is often used as a cache. It can also be used as a storage when the consistency requirements are not high.
